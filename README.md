# Arduino 3.55-Analog Input
## In this assignment you will take what you learned with analog sensors and combine it with `if()` and `else` to begin making decisions.

### Step One: Build the Circuit

Build your circuit according to this schematic (same as lab 3.55):

### Step Two: Write the Code

Before you start, review the Arduino Reference page on [`if()`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/if/).  Also review what you did last week with `analogRead()` as you will need to use those concepts again.

1. Recycle your code from lab 3.55.  You will keep the structure that reads the alalog pin and ad a conditional to it. [Codebender IDE](https://edu.codebender.cc/class/1ajtp).
2. Modify the code so your sketch does the following:
    - Turn on the LED_BUILTIN ligth when the value of 

Use the video below as a reference.

### Step Three: Debug and Submit

Make sure your prototype behaves the same way as the one in the video. As in the previous assignment, make a new file here on GitHub. Name it 3.55_Analog_Input.ino and Commit it to the repository.
